# Movie Genre Classification Model

In this project, I built a classification model that predicts whether a movie is a comedy or a thriller by using only the frequency of words in its screenplay.

Objectives:
1. Build a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier
2. Test the classifier on held-out data

Project Details:

This project was completed for my Foundations of Data Science course at UC Berkeley. The data originates from the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus. After preprocessing the text—such as lowercasing words, filtering out inappropriate terms, and converting raw counts into frequencies—I constructed a dataset representing each movie by the frequencies of the 5,000 most common words in its screenplay.
